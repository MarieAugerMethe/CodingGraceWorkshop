**Description** This package provides a set of functions to analyse
overdispersed counts or proportions. Most of the methods are
already available elsewhere but are scattered in different
packages. The proposed functions should be considered as
complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM).
